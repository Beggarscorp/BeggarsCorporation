BACKGROUND

This is for the first time in the world, the beggars refuse to accept donations, quit begging and want to work to ensure decent life for their children. After year long experiment, Varanasi based Beggars Corporation was finally incorporated as a For-Profit Company - Humanomics Private Limited - on August 12, 2022. It is also recognized by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Govt of India, as a Startup in Social Impact category.



Just before incorporation, we had introduced a Scheme for month long Sawan Jalabhishek this year. 110 members subscribed to it by paying ₹  2500.00 each. It helped us to provide alternative livelihood to 2 beggar families once for all. Success of this scheme inspires us to reintroduce it as an Annual Program.
