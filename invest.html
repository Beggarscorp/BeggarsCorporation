It includes 1,91,997 women, but doesn’t count almost 1.5 lakh children, some with their parents, some without. We call them beggars. Last year, the bench of Justices DY Chandachud and MR Shah of the Supreme Court refused to take an “elitist view” to ban begging and observed – “No person would like to beg unless she/he is forced to do so because of poverty.”

			<strong class="bold"><br>Only ₹  7500 cr can make India begging-free.</strong>
						
<p class="mb-0 text-justify"><br>Let’s close our eyes and dream for a moment, consciously. How much do we need to rehabilitate a beggar? The experiment of the Beggars Corporation in Varanasi has developed a structured model of it. Here is the function wise breakup of the per head cost when implemented in groups: </>
	 
	<p class="pl-100">(1) ₹  5,000 for identification, verification and motivation,                             </p>
    <p class="pl-100">(2) ₹  10,000 for relocation and accommodation,                                           </p>
    <p class="pl-100">(3) ₹  10,000 per month towards Livelihood Compensation during 3 months of Training and   </p>
    <p class="pl-100">(4) ₹  5,000 for Training.                                                                </p>
    <p class="pl-100">(5) ₹  50,000 per beggar to start their own ventures/business.                            </p>
    <p class="pl-100">(6) ₹  25,000 per beggar for Branding & Marketing of  their products/services.            </p>
	<p class="pl-100">(7) ₹  25,000 per beggar for Handholding for 3 years.</p>
	<p>Obviously, we can’t expect beggars to manage their business with 3 months training. They need day-to-day guidance, legal & technical help, active support for both quality and sales of their product/service to survive market competition and complete handholding for 3 years till they repay the fund and become ‘atma nirbhar’. For the first 3 batches, it is absolutely necessary to build their confidence level and create a self-sustainable full-proof system. So, add another ₹  50,000 per beggar for this system including infrastructure, administrative and related expenses. </p>																							</p>
	
	<p class="text-justify">In toto, ₹  1.5 lakh is the budget to ensure sustainable alternative livelihood for one beggar. For roughly 5 lakh beggars, we need 7,500 cr. They, in turn, will not only earn for themselves and send their children to school, but also help us in minimising the related social vices like drugs racket, crime syndicate, child trafficking, poverty rate and charity burden on the country. Besides this, they will contribute in nation building by productive utilisation of their huge idle manpower, paying direct/indirect tax to the state exchequer and boosting GDP.</p>
			
			<strong class="bold "><br>₹  34000 cr, we, the ordinary Indians, donate every year.</strong>

			<img src="images/main/begging-free.png" class="img-responsive about-img pt-35" alt="Awesome Image" />
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			<p class="text-justify"><br>
			See where our sympathies flow to. A hopping ₹  21.5 thousand cr of this goes directly to individuals through informal channels who shed a few drops of tear, genuine or acting. Only 10% (3.3k cr) of it goes to the formal giving like PM/CM Relief Funds, NGOs and crowdfunding platforms. </p>
			
			<p class="text-justify"> <br>We, the sympathetic ordinary Indians, donate more than ₹  34,000 crore or $ 5.1 billion every year. To be precise, it was 34,242 cr in 2017, says the Everyday Giving(EG) Report of Sattva Consulting, Bangalore, a study supported by Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation and Rohini Nilekani Foundation.   </p>

Only 10% (3.3k cr) of it goes to the formal giving like PM/CM Relief Funds, NGOs and crowdfunding platforms</p>
			
			<p class="text-justify">     On the other hand, we need only ₹  7,500 cr to make India begging-free. No need to depend on any government. No need to donate every year without any visible or measurable result. By converting just 25% of our informal giving or donationsof one year into social impact investments, we can make India begging-free once for all. </p>
			
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
			<strong class="bold "><br>Will the beggars work?</strong>
			<p class="text-justify">Yes, they will. In fact, they are working harder than you or me. Living and sitting in the open at one place day long braving heat, rain and cold is something we cannot think of. They know the art of selling better than us - they sell no product or service, yet make us cough up few bucks, willingly or not. Moreover, they don’t feel ashamed or give up, how much we may illtreat them.  </p>
			
			<p class="text-justify">Why are they begging then instead of doing any dignified work? The answer is a counter question: Why do thousands of graduates, post-graduates, engineers apply for Group D post of Railways? When millions of educated youth without Godfathers do not get a job or bank loan for business, how do you think these illiterate poor folk can get? </p>
			<p class="text-justify">Begging is not ‘their’ problem, but ours, as a society. Extreme poverty, unavailability of round-the-year decent paying work to meet the basic needs, helplessness and lack of self-confidence force them into begging. Once we address these needs, why will one refuse to lead a dignified life? If not for them, at least for better future of their children.</p>
			<p class="text-justify"> We agree that all the beggars are not helpless and poor. Like any community or profession, here also you can find deviations - millionaire beggars, conmen, drug peddlers, child traffickers, fakes or super actors. Once we start identification, verification and make I-Cards mandatory for the beggars, the fake-beggars will vanish overnight. </p>
			
			<strong class="bold">Beggars Corporation experiment</strong>
			
			<p class="text-justify">Imagine how the system would have laughed at Muhammad Yunus who started a bank – Grammen Bank- in 1978 in Bangladesh to give no-collateral loans to the poor! After 28 years, the world accepted and honoured his experiment of ‘Banking with Conscience’ in the form of Nobel Prize and called him Banker to the Poor. Not to be surprised, out of his 75 lakh borrowers, more than a lakh were beggars and they all repaid the loans. </p>
			<p class="text-justify">“Instead of simply giving them a charitable donation that would be a one-shot cash infusion, the bank decided to lend money to those who go door-to-door asking for money. The idea was to turn them into traveling salespeople.” – said Yunus in his famous 2008 Stanford speech and added “the project now lends to more than 1,00,000 beggars, and nearly all the loans are paid back in full.”</p>
			<p class="text-justify"> We are taking the experiment few steps ahead in Varanasi through Beggars Corporation with more precaution and conservative approach. Instead of giving away loans, we Motivate, Train, Guide and Handhold them in groups under supervision of our skilled volunteers. We know no one can do everything, but everyone can do ‘Something’. Those Somethings of many can be combined to a Great Thing. It took us long 6 months – from February to July 2021 - to motivate the first one to work. But after that, a small group of beggar families working part time could produce and sell cotton bags worth ₹  5.54 lakhs between October 2021and March 2022. </p>
			<p class="text-justify"> You will be shocked to know how much we invested. A bootstrapped amount of just ₹  10,000. Ours is a market-driven model where we create some samples, take the orders first, then produce & supply, get the payment and reinvest. The biggest investment was our faith in our dream.</p>
			
			<strong class="bold">Don’t Donate, Invest</strong>
			<p class="text-justify">Charity breeds poverty & dependence, investment cultivates responsibility & self-reliance. Productive utilisation of our donations or charity is important to create a system for Work, Profit & Reinvest. Recall the statement from the 1885 novel ‘Mrs. Dymond’ of Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie which is widely quoted by welfare economists – “If you give a man a fish, he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn.”</p>
			<p class="text-justify">But what is the guarantee that the beggars will not fail in business? That doubt we impose on every first-generation entrepreneur or ambitious young talent while rejecting his loan application in the banks. But we didn’t doubt Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya or Mehul Choksi.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Anyway, what do we get in return when we donate to the beggars? Not even Punya. We feed him for a day and don’t bother if he sleeps hungry next day. We encourage more people to beg, destroy work culture, promote all the nuisances attached to begging, create burden on the society and make lakhs of people dependant on our mercy for ever. What’s wrong if we invest on them and give the beggars a chance? </p>
